 - on form-submit, you can grab the uploaded file and move it wherever you want to
 - on form-submit, you'll call the model-functions to save the data gathered from the form


Model

 	- use that to store art_tag entries using the tags selected by the user

 - some form of multis-select or multiple-choice for tags
